        <p>
          A <b>Single Page Application</b>, only the middle of the page re-renders (div with an id of app). The script behind the site is Vanilla JS,
          In the past I've done a few projects in Vue.js and i loved the idea behind components and the abillity to pass props as data, so I splitted
          my code into literal Class components that inherit and extend from other base components. It took some googling to find the right way to do
          it in Vanilla JS but i finally managed to make it work. There's a base component, that all components inherit from that handles the
          rendering of the component on the page and all the logic of the component.
          <br />
          <br />
          The site is fully response to all sizes, using <b>Flexbox</b>, and <b>media queries</b>, uses <b>DayJS</b> for date-handling,
          <b>Chart.js</b> to the display the chart, <b>FuseJS</b> to handle all the huge data searching across the app, and the
          <b>CoinGecko API</b> to fetch the data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="about__project_p">
        <p>
          <span class="about__project__head"> Homepage -</span> The homepage is the first page that the user sees when he opens the site, On document
          ready it fetches all the data from the API, all the <b>15000</b> objects. I implemented an <b>Intersection Observer</b> function that
          detects when the user scrolled down to the bottom of the page to render more coins, That way I have all the data but I don't render it fully
          for optimization purposes. Same goes with the search bar, It searches all the data from the API and it works flawlessly and fast due to the
          intersection observer. It won't render things you don't see unless you scrolled down the list. <br /><br />
          The user is able to click on a coin card to toggle it on, so it'll show in the portfolio section. And can also click on the more info button
          to switch to another <b>dynamic route</b> that is equal to the coin ID. When a user has 5 toggled coins, and clicks on another card to
          toggle it on, A modal will open notifying the user that he can't toggle more coins since he reached the max of 5 coins.

      <div class="about__project_p">
        <p>
          <span class="about__project__head"> Portfolio -</span> The portfolio page shows a chart that was built using <b>Chart.js</b>, it's a simple
          chart that shows the prices of the coins the user toggled on, max of 5 coins. The chart starts all the prices at 0 and is updated every 2
          seconds, so the user can see the price of the coins he toggled on. It also dynamically updates the chart when the user toggles a coin on or
          off.
